This Project is a compilation of multiple HTML files that act as smaller parts of one larger site.
The use of collumns to format the item cards allows for the user to constantly have an item in sight when purchasing.
Additonally the purchase buttons are colored in order to target the users attention to click.
Before I thought that surrounding the cards in frame of color to excentuate them originally but that ended up making them look worse.
In the smaller sites, there are carousels to display all items that are avaliable for purchase at the time, taking up less space and taking more of the user's attention.
For the nav-links I made it so that instead of making the tab you are on change, it will instead generate a new tab for the site that is linked.
The page even changes as the window shrinks/grows in order to give the user a better viewing experience.
